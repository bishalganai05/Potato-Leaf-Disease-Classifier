![Potato Leaf Disease Classifier](ExperimentalImage.png)

## Overview
This repository contains a CNN-based Potato Leaf Disease Classifier. The model is designed to classify various potato leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Its primary aim is to aid farmers in early disease detection and effective management strategies.

## Features
- **CNN Architecture**: Implemented using TensorFlow/Keras, the model architecture efficiently learns and classifies different potato leaf diseases.
- **Dataset**: Utilizes a comprehensive dataset of labelled potato leaf disease images collected from diverse sources.
- **Training and Validation**: Scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and validation ensure robust performance.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics and evaluation methods to assess model accuracy and performance.
- **Prediction**: Allows users to input images for disease prediction using the trained model.
- **Documentation**: Detailed usage instructions, dataset insights, and model architecture information.
